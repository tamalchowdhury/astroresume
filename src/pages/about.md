When someone asks me what I do for a living, I tell them "I am a software engineer". This is because it's easy to give them a one-line answer. But if you really want to know, my identity is more than just writing code. I'm a problem solver, dreamer, creator, and self-improver.

I spend most of my waking hours in front of the computer screen, reading, writing, and creating things. When I am not working, I spend my time looking at nature. My favorite time pass is having a candid conversation with my siblings and mother over some popular internet videos. We have invented many family traditions and rituals of our own like having lunch and dinner together; spending the birthday evening watching internet videos with everyone; having a feast celebrating personal achievements.

My hobby is chess; I picked that up last year and I am getting very good at it. I also love to draw sketches of people and objects. Sometimes I spend time with friends over some online multiplayer games. PUBG Mobile and GTA Online are two games where I get to hang out with buddies.

Self-improvement is a huge part of my daily life. I am always reading and learning how to improve various aspects of my life. From picking up a new skill to working out my body, I am getting better every day.

Now let's talk about relationships. I value and respect every human being I meet online and offline. Love to help and improve other's life even if they are complete strangers I met on the street. A random act of kindness can go a long way. So I always try to help others without expecting anything back from them. To me, relationships are built and cultivated over time. It's not like a switch you can turn ON just like that. I love to work on them.

Welcome to my world!
